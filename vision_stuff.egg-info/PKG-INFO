Description: vision_stuff
        ===========
        Tools for image conversion.
        (vision-tools was already taken, that's why its vision_stuff :))
        
        
        Info
        ===========
        Collection of functions for convertion images with python opencv. For now one useful function is shrink_image and its derivative shrink_and_store_images_dir. It let as to shrink image(s), to specified size. Useful, when we have a couple of different shape images and want all of them to be e.g. 640x640.
        
        
        Install
        ===========
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install vision_stuff
        
        Usage from python
        ===========
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from vision_stuff import shrink_image
        
            # example
            img = cv2.imread('image_to_be_shrinked.png', 1)
            out = shrink_image(img, 400, 400)
            cv2.imwrite('out.png', out)
            
            
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from vision_stuff import shrink_and_store_images_dir
            
            directory = 'different_shape_images'
            shrink_and_store_images_dir(directory)
            # it convert images and store them into new directory named (directory + "_converted")
            
            
        Alghorithm of "shrink_image" function conversion
        ===========
        .. image:: shrink_example.png
        
        Todo
        ===========
        03.06.2020, todo:
        
            - add command line tools
            
            - add more useful function/classes
